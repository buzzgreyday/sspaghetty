# Sspaghetty

## Requirements

* Ubuntu
* Maximum one server running on either Digital Ocean or Hetzners.

## Getting started

The script is in an early stage, therefore the script might not behave as expected if you have multiple projects, servers and/or firewalls on Digital Ocean and/or Hetzner. Support for multiple projects, server and/or firewalls will likely follow in the future.

### 1a. Digital Ocean Server

Setup your Digital Ocean project, deploy your server and setup the firewall rules.

### 1b. Hetzner Server

Setup your Hetzner project name (or rename) it "Constellation", deploy your server and setup the firewall rules.
