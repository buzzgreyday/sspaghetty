# Sspaghetty

## Requirements

* Ubuntu
* Max one Digital Ocean or Hetzner server

## Getting started

The script is in an early stage. Therefore, the script will most likely not behave as expected if you have multiple projects, servers and/or firewalls on Digital Ocean and/or Hetzner. Support for multiple projects, server and/or firewalls will likely follow in the future.

### 1a. Digital Ocean Server

Setup your Digital Ocean project, deploy your server and setup the firewall rules.

### 1b. Hetzner Server

Setup your Hetzner project name (or rename) it `Constellation`, deploy your server and setup the firewall rules.
